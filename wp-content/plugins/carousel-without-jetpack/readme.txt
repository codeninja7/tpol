Transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience without requiring you to connect to WordPress.com

== Description ==

I love this Carousel feature that is part of JetPack however I didn't like that I was being forced to connect my site with WordPress.com to use a feature that has no connection with WordPress.com. Well, I simply forked the Carousel module from JetPack. I am releasing it for all those who want to use this feature with freedom of choice.

The carousel feature transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience with comments and EXIF metadata.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How will you make sure to keep this upto date?**

Well this code is literally a copy of JetPack module. I will keep a close eye on every JetPack update. If they update this module, then I will be sure to update this plugin as well.

**How can I get rid of the Comments?**

I thought long and hard about whether to add this feature in the gallery carousel or not. Because the goal is to transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience, I think that comments are necessary. This is why I will NOT be adding an option to turn the comments off.

However, if you want to turn off comments on Media attachments, you can follow this tutorial:
